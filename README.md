## Easy to use!
This project aims to reverse engineer the Rollotron 1300, a roller shutter control system manufactured by Rademacher. 
The primary goal is to make it compatible with smart home systems using ESP32, ESP8266, and similar platforms. 
The motivation behind this project is to add smart home functionality to existing Rollotron 1300 units that do not originally support such features.
